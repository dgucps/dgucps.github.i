# ABOUT US


**Cyber-Physical System (CPS)** integrates physical components 
(e.g., <span style="color:blue">robots, embedded devices</span>) with digital technologies for networking and control, enabling interaction and collaboration between the physical and digital worlds.
We aim to develop next-generation <u>theory, design tools, and applications</u> to monitor and control units in CPS.
Using **AI technologies**, our approaches include:
- embedded system design,
- simulation-based optimization,
- high-performance or cloud computing, and
- model-predictive control.
