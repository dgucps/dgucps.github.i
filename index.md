# ABOUT US


Cyber-Physical System (CPS) integrates physical components with networking, monitoring, and control systems.
CPS combines the physical and digital worlds, allowing them to interact and collaborate with each other and with humans.
We aim to develop next-generation theory, design tools, and applications for monitoring and controlling units in CPS.
For that, with **AI technologies**, our approaches include
- model-based design,
- simulation-based optimization,
- high-performance computing, and
- distributed control.
